## Clickjacking HW Grading (15 points total)
Homework challenges can be found at http://clickjacking-challenges.r7.io/

## Part 1 - Vulnerabilities (13 points)
Level 1: 2 points

Level 2: 2 points

Level 3: 5 points

Style: 4 points

The webpages you will be creating clickjacking attacks for are http://clickjacking-challenges.r7.io/level/1 /level/2 /level/3. Level 2 and 3 pages take 1 URL parameter: name. The name parameter specifies your UW NetID. This URL is the one you will be embedding in your iFrame on the clickjacking page. The goal is to trick a victim admin (me) into browsing to your page and clicking on something that secretly submits the form of the page in the iFrame. When you test your clickjacking attack your name and the phrase "unavailable" will appear, but when I click on it a the request will properly resolve and I can verify your attack.

TL;DR - To earn full points on the challenges you must craft a webpage that convinces a victim (me) to click somewhere on the page and in doing so submit the form with your information.
